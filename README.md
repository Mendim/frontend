# TellyFe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Checking your new changes

Running `npm run lint` will check your code for errors (only *.ts files) and inform you of any mistakes.

## Some guidelines (WIP)

* Append a dollar sign to the end of Async variables `asyncVariable$: Observable<SomeInterface>`
* Interfaces should be used for models only, not classes.
* When in doubt about something, just ask!
